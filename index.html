VIBGYOR Group of Schools Launched ‘Novella – A Book of Short Stories’
Posted By: Editorial Deskon: April 28, 2019In: RegionalNo Comments Print Email
A first of its kind initiative to promote young authors

VIBGYOR Group of Schools, a leading chain of K-12 schools in India, in its first of its kind initiative launched ‘Novella – A Book of Short Stories’. The book was launched amidst much fanfare in the presence of Dr. Radhakrishnan Pillai, a renowned author, Head of The Write Place Anup Jerajania and VIBGYOR Management Team.

VIBGYOR has always encouraged the reading and writing skills among the students through its various platforms like annual souvenir, Greader’s Club, and many others. This aims to give students a platform to engender creative skills leading to the development of their overall personality.

The short stories explore a range of genres – from fables to sci-fi, from life experiences to horror episodes. Selected from 250 entries submitted from across locations, 25 stories were selected by the jury. Novella is published in association with The Write Place (a publishing arm of Crossword).

Speaking on the occasion VIBGYOR Group of Schools spokesperson said, “Our first of its kind initiative – Novella – is aimed at building a culture of reading and writing among youth and provide a unique platform for budding authors.”

Commenting on the launch, Dr. Radhakrishnan Pillai said, “Writing can create a new world within us and outside us. I am glad that VIBGYOR Group of Schools and its teachers have taken this wonderful effort to get the students published through this book, Novella: A Collection of Short Stories.”</p>
